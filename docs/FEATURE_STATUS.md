# NestKit feature status

This document is the quickest status snapshot for NestKit feature work. It records what is already released, what is being documented for future feature work, and what remains future architecture direction.

## Snapshot

| Feature | Status | Version / phase | Summary | Next step |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `right-sidebar-drawer` | released | released module on the current `0.4.0` line | Desktop-only right sidebar hover drawer with settings, pinning, positioning, live CSS updates, and bilingual UI support | Keep stable while later independent modules are added around it |
| `spaced-review` | released | released module on the current `0.4.0` line | Review task creation, overview, lightweight management, Daily Note sync, and related workflow polish are already shipped | Continue with incremental polish and keep it decoupled from unrelated future modules |
| `heading-progress` | released | released in `0.4.0` as Phase 1A status bar MVP | Independent status bar module for showing line-based progress inside the current top-level heading block of the active Markdown editor, with default-off startup behavior, dual source modes, multiple display modes, and no vault-wide scan | Keep the released MVP stable, validate startup impact in real use, and decide later whether to widen presentation or release scope |
| `reward-reader` | in development | Phase 2B1 Vault source boundary on the current branch | Optional study-to-unlock novel reading module with a default-off feature shell, foundational settings, pure data types, pure store normalization, a detached built-in chapter parser, and a detached Vault-local source inspection boundary | Keep the source inspection detached from startup/runtime wiring and move next into explicit import assembly only after the Vault boundary is stable |
| `workspace-panel-system` | future | future architecture | Stable registry-facing umbrella concept for broader toolbox surfaces beyond the currently released modules | Define when a real shared panel system is needed instead of keeping features independent |
| `dock-router` | future | future architecture | Placeholder concept for routing future docked surfaces without coupling them to the current right sidebar drawer | Clarify actual navigation and placement needs before designing APIs or settings |
| `floating-drawer` | future | future architecture | Placeholder concept for a future floating surface separate from the released right sidebar drawer | Re-evaluate only after clearer workspace-surface requirements exist |

## Released modules

### right-sidebar-drawer

- Status: released
- Version / phase: released module on the current `0.4.0` line
- Summary: This is the original NestKit surface and remains the active workspace customization module. It provides the desktop right sidebar hover drawer, pinning behavior, positioning controls, and related settings polish.
- Next step: Maintain stability and avoid unnecessary behavior churn while other planned modules mature independently.

### spaced-review

- Status: released
- Version / phase: released module on the current `0.4.0` line
- Summary: Spaced Review is already a shipped independent feature area. The current docs and architecture notes cover task creation, overview flows, lightweight management actions, Daily Note sync, and follow-up polish around those surfaces.
- Next step: Continue small, scoped improvements without turning it into a dependency for unrelated modules such as Heading Progress or future workspace-surface work.

## Released in 0.4.0

### heading-progress

- Status: released
- Version / phase: released in `0.4.0` as Phase 1A status bar MVP
- Summary: Heading Progress is now a released independent module. It stays separate from Spaced Review and the right sidebar drawer, remains disabled by default, shows progress inside the current top-level heading section, supports `viewport-center` and `cursor-position` source modes, supports `bar + percent`, `percent only`, and `bar only` display modes, reads only the active Markdown editor, and does not perform any vault-wide scan.
- Next step: Keep the released MVP stable, validate startup impact in real vault use, and if more reading or editor-assist features arrive later, decide whether to keep extending the dedicated tab or regroup those tools under a broader `Reading aids` or `Editor aids` area.

## Planned future feature modules

### reward-reader

- Status: in development
- Version / phase: Phase 2B1 Vault source boundary on the current branch
- Summary: Reward Reader now includes a detached Vault-local source inspection boundary on top of the earlier Phase 1A and Phase 2A work. The current branch keeps the default-off independent feature shell, flat plugin settings fields, dedicated Reward Reader settings tab, pure TypeScript data types, pure store normalization helpers, and detached pure chapter parser, and now also adds a pure in-memory chapter-cache builder plus a Vault reader that validates one Vault-local TXT or Markdown path, reads it once with `vault.read`, assembles an in-memory chapter cache, and returns structured success or failure results. This phase still does not add import UI, novel registration, chapter-index persistence, state persistence, study exchange, reader UI, sidebar UI, status-bar UI, commands, ribbons, or runtime listeners.
- Next step: Keep Phase 2B1 scoped to explicit Vault-local source inspection, validate path and single-read boundaries, and only then move into explicit import assembly and later chapter-index persistence. Detailed planning now lives in `docs/REWARD_READER_PLAN.md`.

## Future architecture directions

### workspace-panel-system

- Status: future
- Version / phase: future architecture
- Summary: This is the broader toolbox direction behind NestKit's feature registry naming. It represents a possible shared system for future workspace surfaces, not a released end-user feature today.
- Next step: Keep this as architecture vocabulary until a concrete cross-feature panel need justifies implementation.

### dock-router

- Status: future
- Version / phase: future architecture
- Summary: Dock Router is a placeholder concept for future placement and routing logic across docked UI surfaces. It is not implemented and should not be mistaken for a current user-facing module.
- Next step: Revisit only if multiple docked surfaces need a common routing layer.

### floating-drawer

- Status: future
- Version / phase: future architecture
- Summary: Floating Drawer is a placeholder idea for a future floating workspace surface separate from the current released right sidebar drawer.
- Next step: Leave this in roadmap status until real usage requirements make it more concrete than a naming placeholder.
